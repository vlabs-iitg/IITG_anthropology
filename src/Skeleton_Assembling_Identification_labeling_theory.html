<h1><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.), the "Father of Physic", is regarded as the pioneer in the field of physical anthropology</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) is a remarkable contributor in the development of physical anthropology. He was a Professor of Anatomy and physician to Charles V and Philip II. His study on the different anatomical features of man and apes did much in bringing revolution in the anatomical studies of those days. The specialty of his study on human&nbsp;<i>anatomy </i>was that he based such study on direct observation and thereby he &#039;was able to bring many new thoughts and ideas in that line. For this reason Vesalius&#039; services to anatomy have been compared to those of Galileo and Copernicus in the astronomical studies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then came the year 1707 which was blessed with the birth of a great man who caused an overall change in the line of thinking and thereby brought a revolution in the development of science. He was Linnaeus (1707-1778).The Systema Nature,his immortal work, first saw the light in the year 1737 and <i>in </i>the tenth edition of that book, in 1758, he attempted at the classification of all known living organisms on the basis of the similarities and differences in various features. In the first edition of the book man was included in the class Quadrupedia and the order Anthropomorpha along with the apes and the sloths. In the tenth edition man, apes, lemurs and bats were placed in the order Primate. Man had been divided into Homo sapiens, Homo ferus, americanus europeaus, asiaticus, afer and monstrogus. It was Linnaeus who designated each Living organism by two Latin names (binary nomenclature), one for genus and the other for species. From the days of Linnaeus man has been scientifically known as <i>Homo sapiens.</i></p>
<p class="Style" style="margin-left:4.8pt;text-align:justify;line-height:150%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;
mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>But it was Lamarck <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">(1744-1829) </span>who came forward boldly with observations on the descent of man from the anthropoid apes. He also pointed out the close resemblances amongst them that were combined with inferiority in bodily and mental capacity.</p>
<p>Johann Fridrich Blumenbach (1752-1840), known as the “father of physical, anthropology," was the real founder of craniology. In his works he attempted to explain human differences on the different grounds. He classified mankind into five varieties, such as the Caucasian, the Mongolian, the Ethiopian, the American, and, the Malay. The study was based on features like hair, colour, and form of the skull. He considered that the form of the skull was of special importance, Blumenbach&#039;s classification on the basis of the structure&#039; of <i>norma uerticalis </i>of the three races of mankind - the Mongols (square shape) ; the Negroes (long and laterally compressed) and the Caucasians (intermediate) gained a worldwide recognition. The writing of Blumenbach touched all about the physical aspects of man-skeleton, teeth, hair, skin and internal organs. It was Blumenbach who introduced for the first time the idea of race classification on the basis of measurements, His contribution in this field placed anthropology on a rational basis. In the later period, the anthropologists like Broca, Fowler, Turner and others have followed the path of Blumenbach in the craniological studies.</p>
<p class="Style" style="margin-left:4.8pt;text-align:justify;line-height:150%"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;
mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-latin"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="Style" style="margin-left:4.8pt;text-align:justify;line-height:150%">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anders Ratzius (1796-1860) brought to light the technique of finding out cranial index and he was the first to classify the crania as dolichocephalic and brachycephalic. In 1840, Ratzius delivered a course of lectures on his theory regarding cranial shapes to the Academy of Science at Stockholm. He tried to correlate the findings of Blumenbach and Camper and thereby arrived at new methods of cranial measurements which were universally accepted. The name of John Grattan (1800-1871) should be remembered here, though he never received his due recognition, for his invention of certain radial measurements on the skull and construction of an ingenious craniometer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The year 1859 is highly remarkable in the history of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Anthropology<b>. </b>With the publication of Charles </span>Darwin’s <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">book </span><i>Origin of species, </i>in the -same year a revolution started in the line of thinking. -But it gave rise to fierce controversies. On the basis of his painstaking researches he put forward the idea that species were not independently created, but they had descended from other species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Risley’s view was not supported by the scholars. Crooke made a strong criticism on this point and he was in favour of rejecting that very idea. The Dravidian type of Risley had also not been accepted by Sergi and Deniker. Chanda, in his book <i>The</i> <i>Indo-Aryan Races: a study of the origin of Indo-Aryan People and Institutions </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(19516) opposed the view of Risley. A. C. Haddon did</span> not agree with the classification put forward by Risley on several points. In his <i>The wanderings of peoples, </i>he stressed that the oldest existing stratum was represented <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">by<i> </i></span>none but various Pre-Dravidian jungle tribes The Dravidians, according to him, could be distinguished into two separate groups -firstly, the medium-statured, dolichocephalic, mesorrhine group and secondly the dark-skinned, short or medium statured, platyrrbin group. Haddon attempted at the reconstruction of the racial background of India and he divided the country into three main geographical regions with characteristic ethnic elements His classification has based on Physical feature, artefacts, customs, language and folk tales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He pointed out that the Aryan speaking people first came in this, country <i>in </i>the second millennium B. C. But he did not clear the point as regards the Pre- Dravidian India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Majumdar did some extensive works on the different groups of people of this sub-continent. He worked among the Ho, Saora, Gond, Bhil and Nuniya caste. In Kolhan he attempted a study on growth of the aboriginal boys. He also made their another study on the height and weight among the different castes and tribes of Gujarat. An anthropometric survey had also been conducted by him in Gujarat which offered a large mass of data on the subject. In this connection, the anthropometric study, conducted in the United Province, P. C. Mahalanobis, D. N. Majumdar and C. R. Rao should be mentioned. They restricted their study among twenty three different castes and tribes. Prof. Mukherjee&#039;s work on the body development of Calcutta children should be mentioned here as it is an example of systematic growth study where he has shown how social class plays a dominant role in influencing the development of the sex differentiating characters. Dr. S. S. Sarkar made some original contributions in the field of physical anthropology in. India. His team worked amongst the Kaoars of Kerala and brought an open challenge to Guha&#039;s observation on the characteristic Negrito hair amongst the tribal people in question. Sarkar&#039;s study on the Race and Race movements in India throws a new light in the study of race in this country. He has attempted to classify the people on the basis of cephalic index and, according to him, India&nbsp;<i>is </i>predominantly a dolichocephalic country. His <i>The Aboriginal Races of India </i>l1954) is considered as a fascinating study which unfolds many new facts in the domain of physical anthropology of tie aboriginal people inhabiting in India.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The  bony and cartilaginous  framework wich supports the soft tissues and  gives a definite form to  the body is called the skeleton”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There  are more than two handred  bones in the adult skeleton. The function of  the skeleton include  providing a supporting framework for your body,  supplying protection  for internal organs and acting as a reservoir for  essential minerals.  By weight, bone tissue is 70% mineral and 30 per  cent organic material.  It is penetrated by many small nerves and blood  vessels. Bone tissue  is continually renewed. Because of this it is able  to repair&nbsp; itself  following injury and, to a certain extent, bones are  able to adapt  their forms according to the mechanical strains imposed  upon them.  Ossification of the bony skeleton begines in about the fifth  week of  foetal life, and skeleton growth is completed by about 25 years  age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">The Composition of Bone</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bone  is a composite material formed  an organic and an inorganic (mineral)  part. By weight, dry bone is  about 70% mineral and 30% organics. The  great majority of the organic  component is collagen, a protein which  forms longs fibres. The small  crystals which make up the mineral portion  of are embedded in matix of  collegen fibres. Bone mineral is chiefly  hydroxyapatite, a form of  calcium phosphate whose composition  approximates to the chemical  formula Ca10(PO4)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>.  The mineral component  gives bone its rigity, and the organic component  lends it a slight  ‘give’ or resiliecne which gives it its strenght. The  organic part  degrades after deaht, which accounts for the rather brittle  nature of  most archaeological bone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The functions of the bone are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; To give support to the weight of the body,</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; To give the protection to the underlying of soft parts,</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;To give a definite shape to the body,</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp; To provide space for muscular attachment ,</p>
<p>(e)&nbsp; To help in lever action for locomotion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There  are more than two hundred  separate bones in the adult skeleton. They  may be divided into four  classes according to theire basic shape and  appearance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Long</li>
    <li>Sort</li>
    <li>Flat</li>
    <li>Irregular.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Skull</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skull may be divided into</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; a cranial part or cranium: forms the brain –box</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp; a facial part: situated below the front portion of the cranium</p>
<p>The cranial part is constituted by the following bones:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Frontal:The region of the forehead or the front of the cranial region</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Parietal Two in number. Each one is irregularly quadrilateral in shape. They form the side walls and roof the brainbox.</li>
    <li>Occipital:The posterior and the interior part of the cranium</li>
    <li>Ethmoid: The  anterior part of base of the cranium, and is cuboidal in shape. It   forms the lateral walls and roof of the nasal&nbsp;&nbsp; cavity, the medial walls   of the orbit and the septum of the nose.</li>
    <li>Sphenoid:  In shape  it resembles a flying bat. It is placed in front of the  temporal bones  and the basal portion of the occipital bone, at the  skull. It consists  of a centrally placed body and two wings – greater  and lesser.</li>
    <li>Temporal: Two in number. They are placed at the base and sides of the skull.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A temporal bone has five parts- the squamous, petrous, mastoid, tympanic parts and the styloid process.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inferior Nasal Conchae:Two in number. Each forms a curved lamina and is placed horizontally in the lateral walls of the nasal cavity.</li>
    <li>Nasal bones:Two in number. These are small bones placed side by side immediately below the frontal, forming the bridge of the nose.</li>
    <li>Lachrymal: Two in number. They are placed near the front part of the medial orbital walls.</li>
    <li>Vomer: It is a thin  bony plate, composed of two fused laminae and is  quadrilateral in  shape. It is situated in the lower part of the septum  of the nose.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bones of the facial part are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maxilla: Two in  number. They form the whole of the upper jaw. Each is placed  below the  orbit forming the floor of the orbit, and also forms the roof  of the  mouth and the floor and the lateral wall of the nasal   cavity. Each maxilla has a body and four processes- frontal, alveolar, zygomatic and palatine.</li>
    <li>Zygomatic:Two in number. Each being situated in the upper and lateral part of the face, makes prominence of the cheek.</li>
    <li>Palantine: Two in  number. It is placed between the maxilla and the pterygoid  process of  the sphenoid bone of the posterior aspect of the nasal  cavity.</li>
    <li>Mandible: It forms the lower jaw and is the largest and strongest bone of the face.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  skull as a whole may be looked  at from above (norma verticalis), from  front ( norma frontalise), from  back (norma occipitalis), from below  (norma basalis), and from the side  (norma lateralis). These different  aspects are to be described  systematically one by one in time of  describing a skull as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Norma vertical:</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following features may be noted:</p>

<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Dentition:</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two  sets of teeth make their  appearance at different periods of life of a  man. The first set, known  as the deciduous or milk teeth, is temporary  and begins&nbsp; to erupt  during the first one year. The other set called the  permanent teeth,  begins to replace the first set from about the sixth  year.</p>
<p>The deciduous set consists of 20 teeth of which 4 incisors, 2 canines and 4 molars are found in each of the upper and lower jaw.</p>
<p>The permanent teeth are 32 in number. The dental formula is</p>
<p>Molar premolar canine incisor incisor canine premolar molar</p>
<p>Upper   jaw 3 2 1 2 2 1 2 3 Lower   jaw 3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each tooth presents three different Parts, viz:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; The crown: the projected portion beyond the gum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; The root: portion that lies embedded in the sockets of the maxilla or mandible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; The neck: the constricted portion between the root and the crown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Incisors:they form the front teeth in each dental arch. The crown is chisel- shaped. An incisor bears only one root.</li>
    <li>Canine: the crown is large and conical. The root is usually single.</li>
    <li>Premolars:The  present two pyramidal cusps or tubercles, one lingual and other  labial,  the two being separated by a groove. The root is usually single.</li>
    <li>Molars:
    <ul>
        <li>Upper molars  – the crown of the first, second and third molars present  4, either 3  or 4 and 3 cups respectively. Each molar has 3 roots.</li>
        <li>Lower molars; the first molar presents 5 cups while the second and third have 4 or 5 cups. Each lower molar possesses 3 roots.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hyoid  Bone: The hyoid bone is U –  shaped. It is placed in the ventral floor  of the pharynx below the base  of the tongue, in front of the epiglottis.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Vertebral Column</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The  vertebral column is made up of a  series of independent, irregular bones,  called the vertebrae,  intervened by fibro – cartilaginous discs, termed  the intervertebral  discs. The vertebrae are&nbsp;&nbsp; firmly connected to one  another in such a  manner that very little movement is possible between  adjacent bones.  The vertebral column supports the weight of the body and  transmits it  to the pelvis and lower extremities. It also protects the  spinal cord  and its membranes.</p>
<p>A  typical vertebra consists of a  body and a vertebral arch. These two  enclose a foramen, termed the  vertebral foramen through which the spinal  cord a pair of pedicles and  of laminae. It has a spinous process, two  transverse processes and four  articular processes.</p>
<p>They can be grouped under the names of:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbspnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cervical:they are seven in number. They are the smallest of the moveable vertebrae.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thoracic:Twelve in number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lumber:5 in number</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sacral:the 5 sacral vertebrae fuse with one another to form a lorge, triangular bone, called the sacrum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Coccygeal or Caudal:</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The  rudimentary vertebrae of this  region form a small triangular bone by  fusion. The number of vertebrae  is 4, but it may be 5 or even 3.</p>
<p>When looked at the lateral side, the vertebral column presents 4 curves, namely, cervical, thoracic, lumber and pelvic.These  4 curves make the vertebral  column S – shaped as the cervical curve is  convex forwards, the  thoracic one is concave forwards, and the lumber is  convex forwards,  while the pelvic curve is again concave forwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Ribs</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The  thoracic region contains 12 ribs  on each side. Of each series of 12 the  upper seven are directly  connected with the sternum by cartilages. They  are called true or  sterna ribs, the reminder are false or asternal. The  cartilages of the 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>  ribs  are joined each to the cartilages of the one immediately above.  The  anterior ends of the remaining 2 are free and they are called  floating  ribs.</p>
<p>The  sternum is a long, flat bone,  composed of several parts, of which the  first piece is the longest and  is termed the manubrium. The succeeding  piece is called the body and  the last one termed the xyphoid process.The sternum is placed in the front wall of the chest.</p>
